                  <p class="choice_text">Jonathan earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Colorado State University 4 years ago, and has since been working in various software teams since. Lately he has found his true passion as a cybersecurity professional, and everything he knows about the topic is from Dr. Joe Gersch. Dr. Gersch is a old friend and colleague of yours, and you know the depth of knowledge and paranoia about security that he imparts on his students is champion.</p>

                      <p class="choice_text">Timothy took an online course in blockchain after dropping out of college attempting to earn a degree in web design. Through much online research during his 2 year stint of unemployment living at his parents house, he discovered cybersecurity professionals have the opportunity to make a lot of money! Luckily for you, he'll likely agree to anything more than nothing so he can stop living with his parents. </p>

                      <p class="choice_text">Frank has been around computers since the day he was born (which is pretty close to when computers were born!). Frank has been creating software before cyber security was ever mentioned, and he knows how vulnerable legacy and unmanaged code can be. In recent days, he has gotten up to speed in defensive programming and modern software exploits, and he doesn't trust the Internet of Things for 1 microsecond.</p>
