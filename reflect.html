                In the stories, you faced choices about fake emails, fake websites, internet router settings, 
                free wifi, and facebook/general scams. The tips outlined in response to your choices
                represent a nice basis for basic internet safety. In this webtext I will elaborate on those principles and
                attempt to demystify computer security, also called cybersecurity. Computer security is a branch of computer science
                dealing with the safety of information on and traveling between computers. It is both extremely 
                important and extremely hard to implement and understand, and I will to translate the most relevant parts of it 
                into a clear and accessible form. The most important part of computer security for everyone to understand is
                the importance of using an antivirus, and I will examine and explain this statement. The bottom
                line of elementary computer security is that everyone should utilize antivirus software and apply basic internet
                security practices when interacting with computers.

            <p>Cybersecurity evolves and changes as we grow to understand both computers and security better. Additionally and unfortunately, there are two sides to
                to every coin: for every security-minded lawful programmer there are many hackers trying to steal your data. Combining the relative novelty of this topic, the aforementioned ratio, and 
                the difficulty of securing online entities, I present it is not a stretch and may even be an understatment to call cybersecurity extremely difficult. 
                One of the reasons cybersecurity is so tough is demonstrated by Wallden and Kashefi in their article "Cyber Security in the Quantum Era", where
                the implications of quantum computing on current security meaures is discussed and analyzed. They find that in quantum computing the field is going
                to have to advance further to handle computing that is not currently possible. For instance, RSA is an encryption mechnanism used by
                social media sites,  banks, and more to make sure your data isn't readable to anyone but you, and "it would be the demise of RSA should
                quantum computing happen" (Numberphile2). However, Wallden and Kashefi also argue that quantum methods for security can
                and will be stronger than RSA and other current algorithms. There are many conflicting views of the effect quantum 
                computing will have on the world of computer security, and that just adds to the difficulty of understanding the topic.

                Internet access and usage in the modern age is nearly ubiquitous and required; it is hard to find many remaining occupations
                or hobbies that don't involve the internet in some way. This means there's a lot of internet traffic and users, and 
                the hackers mentioned above learned pretty quickly that the internet isn't safe on its own. Thus, computer security is
                of utmost importance to make sure the millions and billions of internet users are keeping their information secure. Johnson, Mohr,
                Boyd, and Whittaker each tell stories of when information hasn't been secure - ranging from backdoors in Linux distributions
                to how hackers can steal your credentials at your local Starbucks. The gist of each story is the same: internet users
                were not applying safe practices and it opened up vulnerabilties that could've (or did) lead to data exposure. 
            </p>

            <p>
                    Whittaker tells of a hacker
                    who goes by "Peace" subverting Linux Mint (an operating system, like Windows) downloads to add a backdoor and create a 
                    botnet with those who downloaded the subverted version. Unlike the other stories, this one has the least involvement with 
                    regular internet users, as most of them use Windows or Mac OS, but is still very dangerous. The most dangerous hacks and exploits
                    are the ones the user never even knows about, and since the botnet and backdoor would be invisible to any user who wasn't 
                    explicitly looking for them, many of the victims of this backdoor would likely never have found out. This is the importance 
                    of computer security in a nutshell; it is the responsibility of the computer scientists who actually look for those vulnerablities to help the regular
                    users browse the internet safe. However, and more importantly, it is the responsibility of the regular users to trust those computer scientists
                    and employ the strategies they lay out for them. That all sounds well and good, but what are those strategies?

            <p>
                This section contains the various basic internet safety practices compiled from my research; this is by no means a comprehensive list. 
                However, following the practices laid out here will likely be enough to secure any normal internet users activity. By normal here 
                I mean those not involved in the corporate or academic world of computer science, eg. liberal arts professors all the way to 14 year
                olds who just want to play Minecraft. The first few practices are inspired by a list created by Hoffman and Toaz for
                How-To Geek, a site dedicated to explaining technology. They first strongly recommend enabling automatic updates for
                your operating system and applications. Since almost every application and software you use has vulnerabilities, whether they've
                been found yet or not, it is very important you always have the most up-to-date versions with up-to-date security. 
                For instance, when a new attack vector or exploit is discovered, the creators of the software may send out a hotfix
                within a day, but if you don't automatically update and don't check, your version it may contain
                the vulnerability for a longer period of time.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Hoffman and Toaz continue to mention using antivirus anti-malware software. But what if you're careful on the internet
                already, like when you apply all the tips you learned in the stories of this webtext? Do you still need an antivirus?
                The short answer is yes, and it boils down to some interesting ramifications of malware. Being safe on the internet
                by analyzing hyperlinks, using strong passwords, and detecting fake websites and scams works very well for protecting
                yourself from yourself. However, it doesn't work so well at protecting you from new and dangerous exploits found
                by hackers each and every day, and that's where antivirus comes into play. Antivirus software is getting better
                and better at being able to adapt to new viruses, and some are even employing machine learning to detect new
                malware.  The bottom line is that safe internet practices will protect you from most threats, but that extra
                and arguably necessary line of defense is antivirus software. The built-in Windows Defender antivirus
                should be good enough for most home Windows users, and it won't ask you to install a bunch of other software
                like many other antiviruses will. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The last remark of Hoffman and Toaz I would like to mention is to never leave your electronics unattended. 
                It sounds extremely simple, and is, but is one strong security practice that is violated very often (Gersch)!
                Imagine your laptop's data is encrypted, you have a very strong password to unlock it, you have an antivirus,
                and you always apply safe internet strategies, but you leave it open while you use the restroom. Now I, 
                playing the role of hacker in this scenario, walk up to your laptop, say, turn off your antivirus, send a copy
                of all your files to myself, download as much malware as I please, then delete any trace I was ever there.
                Even better, I'll just steal your laptop and do this all from the comfort of my own home.  
                You did everything else right! But, none of it mattered because I was able to access your laptop that you left
                for me to mess with. Hennig, in her own list of best cybersecurity practices recommends having a "Find My 
                Phone" app to make sure you have a way to delete data if your device gets compromised and/or stolen. Hoffman, 
                Toaz, Hennig and I all strongly recommend not only to lock your devices if you're away from them, but carry 
                them with you wherever you go if at all possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                To finish out out the best practices I'd like to list here, that operate in conjuction with everything you
                learned from the questions, I'd like to divert away from the actual usage of the internet and applications
                slightly. Hennig, who opens her list of practices by advising you to evaluate your security needs, 
                discusses creating backups of all your data. This refers to your files and application data that need
                securing. The idea is to create backups because the safest procedure after your data is
                compromised (however it may be compromised) is to delete it then restore it from a backup. In this way,
                the attacker loses any information they had over you, and you don't lose any data in the end. Truthfully,
                backups, whether offline (safer) or online (easier), are a good idea regardless of security. Computers
                are a wild brain-child and conglomeration of electrical engineering and our preposterous success
                in <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/6jz6l1/cpus/djibn7m/?context=3" target="_blank">
                    tricking rocks to think</a>, so things are bound to go wrong sometimes. Computers crash, hardware dies,
                    unexpected things happen. Be safe, both in terms of security and data integrity, by having backups
                    of your data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rounding out these tips and strategies is Hennig and the use of a password manager and the large
                number of benefitsthat come with using one. Not only are most good enough are recognizing 
                login input forms on websites (that you've been to) to automatically enter your stored credentials,
                but some can even suggest strong passwords for you. The real win is that almost all will encrypt 
                your stored passwords so all you have to remember is one master password to access them. Of course,
                that means you need to have a really good master password and keep it secure, but that's much easier,
                and it turns out, much more secure than trying to remember whether you wrote "c4ulif1ow3r" or 
                "Cau1ifl0wEr", etc. for each and every account. Passwords like those, with random capital letters 
                and numbers in place of the correct letters to spell a real world are very easy to guess by computer
                and brute force. Passwords suggested by password managers tend to have much more entropy, or randomness,
                and are therefore much harder to brute force guess, ie. just try a bunch of combinations until one 
                works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Applying the five big practices in this section in addition to everything you learned in the stories
                from earlier will make the internet a much safer place for you to browse and interact with others. 
                Always remember to check email links, check website URL's and domain names, not connect to free public
                wifi without a VPN, change your default router settings, and watch out for things that seem too
                good to be true. Adding automatic updates, antivirus software, keeping your devices on you, making
                regular data backups, and using a password manager doesn't seem to bad after that. With these 10
                things in mind, not only will you keep any cybersecurity-minded people in your life very happy,
                you'll be protecting your data, money and online image much better than most. Cybercrime is a lot
                like robbery in this way - the minimum defense will likely deter criminals.

                    One of the most important of the 10 best security practices I've outlined is using 
                    antivirus and anti-malware software, and I'd like to look at two more reasons 
                    endorsing their use. The first comes from a popular tech-related YouTube channel based in Canada
                    called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips" target="_blank">Linus Tech Tips</a>,
                    that also happens to be one of my favorites. In a particular video, "Linus visits the 
                    SKETCHIEST sites on the Web", Linus Sebastian, the creator and main figure of Linus Tech Tips
                    does exactly what the title says he does. However, he is using Bitdefender, an antivirus
                    that claims to stop Day 0 attacks, stop ransomeware from encrypting your folders, and
                    totally protect you from malicious websites. Surprisingly, at least to me, Linus is basically 
                    unable to corrupt his computer even while visiting a compiled list of the sketchiest
                    websites and clicking every link he sees. Bitdefender succeeds in stopping him from
                    downloading malware and even visiting many of the websites! This just shows how
                    good modern antivirus software has gotten, and even though you likely won't
                    be doing the same thing Linus was, it helps to have an extra strong line of defense
                    against malware and bad websites.

                        Through the story and this webtext the basics of computer security and advocacy of antivirus software have been
                        discussed and clarified. The field of computer security has much, much more depth, and so does its counterpart
                        hacking. This means there are innumerably more security topics to be worried about, however, that is the job 
                        of cybersecurity professionals and trained, experienced programmers - not the average internet user. Fortuitously,
                        average users can abstract the responsibility of complicated cybersecurity to the programmers, but the responsiblity
                        of using software and the internet safely is immutably the user's. The knowledge of basic cybersecurity principles
                        (review each mention here) and user of and antivirus is ordinarily enough to fulfill that duty. I encourage all
                        internet users to make sure they are aware of and understand basic internet safety practices and to make use of
                        antivirus software.
